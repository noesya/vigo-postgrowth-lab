        <p>The group's main office is located at calle <b>Benito Corbal 45,5th floor</b>. </p><p>The Benito Corbal office has a "fishbowl", a closed room that can and should be used for face-to-face or virtual meetings, avoiding whenever possible to hold this type of meeting in the open area so as not to disturb the staff at work. Bookings will be made through a shared calendar which can be accessed from <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=dmVrdDc2azkwNm1vNnRpMGs0OTRic2VsbW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ">this link</a>. </p><p>In addition, the following spaces are also available:</p><ul><li>  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fj6AqdNwha3a3d5q7" target="_blank"><b>School of Economics and Business Administration</b></a><b></b> (Campus Lagoas-Marcosende, Vigo): offices 309 and 144. To use these spaces, please contact Cristina Vázquez in advance. (<a href="mailto:crisvsantos@uvigo.gal">crisvsantos@uvigo.gal</a>). </li></ul><p>  </p><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3yJrttgdU4mJFYyCA" target="_blank">Business School in Vigo</a></b> (Torrecedeira St., building next to Peritos): There is a large room, number A313, where Carlos Iglesias (Calu) has his office, but additional tables are available for anyone who needs to use them. When they are to be used, it is advisable, however, to contact Calu beforehand to inform him (<a href="mailto:calu@uvigo.gal">calu@uvigo.gal</a>). </li></ul><p>Although teleworking is not officially regulated at the University of Vigo, the group's policy is that those who wish to telework may do so. However, it is recommended that at least those who are contracted under the group's projects, <b>attend at least two days a week in person at the office</b> at Benito Corbal 45, preferably in the mornings. Group members should also attend in person when there are scheduled activities such as seminars, conferences, or workshops, unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent them from doing so, such as being traveling, on leave, or due to work-related reasons. </p><p>  </p><p>Working hours are flexible, and it is the responsibility of each person to comply with the hours stipulated in their contract. However, to facilitate the dynamics of the group, it is recommended that, <b>whenever possible, part of the working day should take place between 10.00 and 13.00</b>, both in person and remotely. In this way, there will always be a time slot in which to schedule activities or to contact other group members without invading their private lives.</p>

      Travel &amp; Events Attendance

        <p>Whenever a trip is to be made that involves leaving the usual place of residence, unless it takes place during holiday periods or days off, the person in charge (PI of the project under which the group member is contracted) and the management team must be informed. This rule is not intended to control the group's personnel, but rather to ensure safety and improve work dynamics. </p><p>As indicated in the previous section, teleworking is not regulated at the University of Vigo and, therefore, all the people who work in this entity only enjoy coverage against possible contingencies that may occur during the working day while they are in the facilities of their work centre and during the journey between their home and the centre (before and after the end of the working day). If during a trip that we have not notified to the person in charge some kind of accident occurs, we may encounter a problem when carrying out certain procedures, such as requesting a sick leave due to an accident at work or <i>in itinere</i>, since the mutual insurance company may not cover our salary during the time we are unable to work because the accident took place in a different city from the one in which our workplace is located. In addition, the notification of our trips and journeys will also facilitate the dynamics of the group, for example, when choosing the date for an activity, so that it can take place when most of the group members are able to attend.</p><p>On the other hand, in order to keep a better record of the activities carried out by each person in the group, an <a href="https://universidadevigo-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sonia_pascual_uvigo_gal/Ea6fmUpyiIJKi_bQHpydFIABgswTU7iPY_hqdy7w_LIDvg?e=55ihMQ" target="_blank">Excel spreadsheet</a> has been set up to record information on attendance and participation in scientific, dissemination and other types of events carried out in the context of the work activity.</p><p> This information is necessary for the preparation of the group's annual reports, and the contribution of each member greatly facilitates the collection of this information for the preparation of these reports.<br></p>

        <p>In general, the staff of the group contracted for R&amp;D&amp;i projects is governed by the <a href="https://www.xunta.gal/dog/Publicados/2011/20110414/Anuncio11926_es.html">PDI labour agreement</a> regarding days off and holidays, which states that each person will be entitled to:</p><ul>  <li><b>22 working days of holiday per year</b></li>  <li><b>9 working days for private affairs</b></li>  </ul><p>In addition, there will be the possibility of taking leave days for reasons of reconciling personal, family and work life in exceptional circumstances such as marriage, illness of a direct relative, moving house, maternity/paternity... To find out how many days correspond to these circumstances, you should check article 37 of the aforementioned agreement and, if in doubt, contact the PDI office.</p><p>In order to improve working dynamics and to avoid being contacted by other members of the group during our days off, it is necessary to inform about the days off and holidays to be taken. To do this, the following should be done: </p><p>1.       Send to the group management team the <a href="https://universidadevigo-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/sonia_pascual_uvigo_gal/EWJNBJ1wTOdGhwbtqT1OZAkBrxY74uFvhBwZRuoimZS8GA?e=ln1KJL"><b>holiday request form</b></a> or the <a href="https://universidadevigo-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/sonia_pascual_uvigo_gal/EcwG5WZ8VuRMqjBkgl6XzmABHa4spG3KoPUHvtTqV7Fpxw?e=8MzQpl"><b>private affairs request form</b></a> signed by the applicant and the person in charge. This should be done as far in advance as possible.</p><p>2.      Indicate in the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bzZlcmFpZDFoOG5lbGxqZHM5czNlcHRiaDRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ"><b>shared calendar</b></a> the days of holidays/private affairs to be taken, so that the rest of the people in the group can be aware of our absence.</p>
