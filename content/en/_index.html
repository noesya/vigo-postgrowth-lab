        <p>What would Science, Technology and Innovation look like in a world not driven by the endless pursuit of economic growth? What new worlds might we be able to conceive if human wellbeing and the natural environment were the primary focus of innovation? Here at the Post-Growth Innovation Lab, these questions lie at the heart of our work. </p>
